# SuperMarioWorld
An amazing 2D Mario game made with C++ and SFML

Commands:
- Left and Right arrows to move Mario
- ... that's it for now ^^

What has been done:
- Communication between GameEngine, GraphicsEngine and SoundEngine
- Display of the window with background, floor and Mario
- Mario can fall at the beginning of the level, then move left and right: the arrows give him an acceleration. He also kind of slides when you release the buttu
on.
- A debug mode that displays extra information

What next ?
- Sprite management (and handling of animations)
- Physics (gravity, friction) -> Jumps
